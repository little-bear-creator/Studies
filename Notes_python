# While working on commandline challenges, I've found "Regular expression" that coul be usefull for my python challenges. 
# I have to search how they work on python !
# For example :
# “[a-z]” matches all the lowercase letters. “[a-zA-Z]” matches all of the letters. “[a-zA-Z0-9]” matches alphanumeric 
# characters. Inside of the brackets, the “^” character negates anything. “[^a-zA-Z]” matches anything that’s not a letter.
